Reflect:
How do you feel about the first day of class?
A little concerned about the content of this class and if it is going to teach me what I want to learn.  The biggest issue is I do not know what I need to learn until I learn it.
Do you think that your learning style is going to work well?
As long as Justin does not mind me asking questions, I feel that my learning style is going to work well.

Review:
What, if anything, do you still have questions about?
I am a little confused on the reason why Git wants you to add something first, then commit it.  What use does this have?
Summarize what each of the commands do:
ls = list
cd = change directory
mkdir = Make Directory
touch = make file (but add an extension)
git init = Start the LOCAL repository
git status = Check the status
git add "Week 1" = adds this to the tracking or stages the folder for committing
git commit -m "This is the message you are writing for yourself for the log"
git log = Shows the status of the commits
