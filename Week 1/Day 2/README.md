Reflect:
(PERSONAL QUESTION) How do you feel about your second day of class?
A lot of the items discussed were new including JavaScript commands.  I understand that we are learning and am keeping an open mind that this will all make sense soon.  I feel that I am able to follow along well.

How do you feel about your first webpage?
I was happy to see it show, but I have no idea what I did to get it to show other than type like a lemming.
What was the most difficult aspect of creating the html page?
There was none.
What, if anything, do you still have questions about?
I know we just typed the server.js JavaScript code, but have no idea what it is doing.  I would like to know what each command is doing, even if I don't understand it yet because it helps to create the relational relationships later in the course.  If I were learning to drive a car, I don't want to know that you get in, start it, push the gas pedal to go, the brake to stop and turn the steering wheel to turn.  I want to know when I start it, what the engine is doing and why is it making noise.  Just me I guess.

Review:
npm init = initialize the node package manager
npm install express --save = This is grabbing the express plugin for node and install it in the current directory
node server.js = starts the JavaScript

What is the DOCTYPE?
It is a declaratory statement letting the computer know what document type it is reading.
What is the difference between the <head> and the <body>?
The <head> is where the meta data is stored as well as the title for the webpage (that would be listed in the tab in a browser)
The <body> is where the visual content of the webpage exists.
