Reflect:
What is the best thing about this class for you thus far?
The fact that Justin has been very good with answering my questions without physically strangling me.  I like to ask a lot of questions, even if it is for other people.  I paid a lot of money for this class and did not receive a scholarship, so I want to get out of it as much as possible.
What would happen if you made an <h7> tag in a web page?
It looks like a standard paragraph tag.
How would you describe an html page to a middle school kid?
An html page is like a set of instructions that tell the web browser how to display the text you want to show on the page.
Review:
Decribe each of the following html tags:
1. h1 = header 1, makes it bold
2. h3
3. li
4. ul
5. ol
6. span
7. div
8. em
9. strong
10. p
