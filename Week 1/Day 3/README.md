Reflect:
What is the best thing about this class for you thus far?
The fact that Justin has been very good with answering my questions without physically strangling me.  I like to ask a lot of questions, even if it is for other people.  I paid a lot of money for this class and did not receive a scholarship, so I want to get out of it as much as possible.
What would happen if you made an <h7> tag in a web page?
It looks like a standard paragraph tag.
How would you describe an html page to a middle school kid?
An html page is like a set of instructions that tell the web browser how to display the text you want to show on the page.
Review:
Decribe each of the following html tags:
1. h1 = header 1, makes it bold and larger text
2. h3 = header 3, make is bold and still larger that <p> but smaller than h1 and h2
3. li = list, this tag states that the items inside this tag are in the defined list (either an ordered or unordered list)
4. ul = unordered list, this is basically a bulleted list item
5. ol = ordered list, this is a numbered list
6. span = ?
7. div = ?
8. em = emphasis, this italicises whatever is in the tag
9. strong = bold, this bolds whatever is in the tag
10. p = paragraph, sets the styling to standard paragraph.
