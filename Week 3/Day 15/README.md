Reflect:
Answer the following questions:
This class can be difficult at times, how does it compare to the things that you have done before?
Once I understand the concept of what the syntax is doing it doesn't become as difficult.  I understand the logic and what I WANT to do, but not knowing HOW to do it is frustrating at times.  This is not the most difficult thing I have done, but it can seem overwhelming once you see the breadth of available options you can do within one context structure (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) let alone multiple ones.  It is an ungodly amount of information.
We all have our own ideas and ways that we prefer to accomplish tasks, how do you think that people would fair if the class was run the way you prefer?
Probably not very well.  If I understand a concept, I want to move on, and will help my fellow students understand it so we can move on; however, there are times when I get stuck on something and everyone else "gets" it and I am totally lost and don't want to hold up the class.  I ask a lot of questions and some of my past classmates (not this class) have come to me after class and thanked me for asking questions because they were too scared to ask.  I hope that I am not interrupting the class with the questions I am asking, but I need to understand before I can move on.


Review:
Describe, in words not code, how you would accomplish each of the following:
1. Add a mouseenter event handler to every anchor tag on the page that changes the text size.
I would declare a variable and place all of the anchor tags in it using the query select all.  I would then add an event listener that listens for on mouse enter (not sure where the "enter" would occur) and run a function that changes the text size for each of those tags.
2. Add a user login page to your website so that people only see the pages you want them to see.
I would create a form that asks for a username and password and check to see if they exist in the user database (have no idea how to do that yet).  If they were found in the system and their username and password validated, I would give them access to the pages I want them to see (but have no idea how to display or not display this based on that criteria).
3. Position an image in the center of the page.
I would create a div element and put the image within the that element and style it with CSS to position the image id or class (dependant of various scenarios) with the proper positioning/aligning attributes.
