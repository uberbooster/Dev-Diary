Reflect:
1. You have learned three different languages up until this point, which one is easiest to you, HTML, CSS, or JavaScript? Why?
At this point probably HTML, because I have been reading it for a longer period of time and do not know all the syntax for CSS and JavaScript, but I am intrigued with JavaScript and what it can do to make your HTML documents more interactive.

2. We have just touched on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, what was the most difficult concept of those three things to you?
For HTML, it knowing all of the available tags and how to use them.  For CSS, it is knowing what properties are available, how to use them, and how they interact with various HTML tags.  I specified a div class with the same styling as an input class and if the class is applied to the div that surrounds the input tag, it formats it differently than if I remove that class and apply it directly to the input tag.  So I guess the most difficult concept to understand with CSS is how each reacts and interacts with each HTML tag.

3. What is a site that you could build with your skills up until this point?
At this point, a very basic site that will allow for various changes in styling based on a user's actions, but not anything that would really be functional for any purpose just yet; however, I am excited to see how each "may" be used to see the cause and effect.


Review:
1. I need to grab a button, with the id 'clicky' and the classes 'btn btn-default', to change the styling when the button is clicked.  Which one of the JavaScript selector functions would you use?
I would use the getElementById since there is only one element with the id clicky.

2. What are some of the events that you can 'listen' for and respond to with DOM elements?
You can listen for a plethora of events such as mouse clicks, mouse movements, keyboard events, frame/object events (such as if an error occured, if a page is resized, scrolled on, or loaded), form events, drag events, clipboard events, print events, media events, animation events, transition events, server-sent events, etc.

3. What is provided to you when you use the getElementById? How is this different than the getElementsByClass?
getElementById gives you the HTML for the tag where the id is specified.  Since there is only supposed to be one id by element, it should return the HTML for THAT id.  getElementsByClass differs from the getElementById in that it returns an HTMLcollection of tags that contain the corresponding class marker.
