Reflect:
Answer the following questions:
What do you think about the code-along procedure of the class?
  I like the concept, but feel that the result is being shown before we have an opportunity to "code-along" and are playing catchup with the typing of the code.
What would be the alternative if you do not?
  To describe and show the coding, then ask the class to either code the same thing without showing us the code (or do something similar, but use different variable names).
What is your greatest obstacle to creating a web application at this point?
  Not having a full understanding of real world use for what we are coding.  Up until now, we are learning syntax and various functions (or ways to assign variables or get info and put them in variables), but to actually utilize this in an application seems perplexing because I have not been able to place it in my head how to use it in the real world.
What is one thing that you could do to get better with JavaScript?
  Control the user experience.

Review:
Answer the following questions:
1. What does the word 'var' mean and how do you use it?
    var declares that you are going to use a variable named whatever comes after the var.  For example, var numberOfDoors; tells JavaScript (or whatever it is) that there is now a variable called numberOfDoors.  It does not assign anything until you put an = after the variable.  For example, var numberOfDoors = 12, declares the variable numberOfDoors and assigns it a value of 12.
2. What does the following line of code do? (Be specific).
var aThing = [1,'two', false];
    It declares a variable aThing and designates it with a data type of an array and assigns the index [0] as the number 1, [1] as the string 'two', and [2] as the boolean false.
3. What are the datatypes for the following:
true  = Data Type: boolean
'true' = Data Type: string
3 = Data Type: number
{1: 'one', 2: 'two'} = Data Type: Object
