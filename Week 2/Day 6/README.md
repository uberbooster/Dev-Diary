Reflect:
What was the most frustrating thing about today?
Looking at two different html pages and find the differences between each.

Why do you think that good code conventions are in place?
So when someone else who did not write the code has to go and debug or read it, they can follow along in a logical or understandable manner.  It also makes it easier for you to go back and re-read your OWN code when necessary.

How would you describe the box model to someone that has never seen a computer?
Think of the box model as an advertisement on a billboard.  Each element (such at the words you are reading or a picture on the billboard) has certain properties.  Imagine that you have to design the look of the billboard by cutting out those elements separately and placing them on one page, which means you can move them around individually.  You may have 3, 4, 5 or more elements that need to be located in a specific area of the billboard.  Each of those elements is considered a "box" and has a margin, height, width, border, and padding.

2. How would you make sure that you do not suffer through what we did today?
By using external stylesheets.
3. What is padding?
The space between the content and the border.
4. What is margin?
The space after the border and the where the next element will start.
5. What does the following do?
a:hover {
    background-color: #FFF;
}
It changes the background color to white on the anchor <a> when you hover over it.
