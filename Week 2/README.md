Reflect:
Could you make a simple website utilizing what you have learned thus far?
Yes, but it would not look pretty. However, we have not been instructed how to publish a website for Internet viewers to see, so even though we can make a simple html document that says "Hello World", we cannot yet publish it to the web.
What do you feel is the most difficult to understand about git and the git workflow?
Git is a bit confusing unless you have used a command line prompt before.  Even though I know git is a version control system, we have not utilized any of the features to "go back" to a point in time to see how really useful it can be.  Right now, we just inititalize, add files (and exclude files), commit the changes to the repository with a message about what we did/changed, and push them to github.
What is the most interesting thing that you have learned thus far?
One of the most confusing things for me before this class was understanding the <div> tag.  While I still do not fully understand it, I understand that there are additional tags that can be used in place of the div tag, such as the address, aside, section, footer, etc.

Review:
Describe the git workflow up until this point.  Be specific about the order and the reason.
Once you create your root/home directory, you must inititalize it using git init.  Then you use git add . to add all the "new" files/folders to the staging area, then you use git commit -m "initial commit" to commit your first version of the repository.
What is the difference between <ul> and <ol>?
ul is an unordered list tag and ol is an ordered list tag.  The ul tag creates bulleted lists and the ol tag creates numbered lists.
What does the <a> allow you to do with a webpage?
The <a> is an anchor tag and let you anchor a picture file, text, or other object to a hyperlink, so if someone clicks on the link, it will take them to the src webpage.
